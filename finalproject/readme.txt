Project Name: Apple-ying Gravity 
Project Submitters: Aishwarya Varma
Game
How to Play: Click to begin. Use your right and left arrows to move Isaac Newton so that the apples will fall on his head. 
Try not to lose any! If you lose 3, you lose! However, if you manage to collect 25, you win! Avoid the worms, they will
make you lose automatically. The game will get harder as you progress because the apples will fall faster from the sky.
